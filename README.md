# Project

This is a small bribe of my first attempt at coding a retro text RPG bits by bits.

The main goal is to learn python as I progress on this project which implies the following :

- Story driven turn based retro RPG only relying on text.
- any battles are 1 on 1 combat.
- One player against random generated enemies outside of a few key encounters from a floor to another.

the battle_code.py file showcase a minimal idea of the battle but still is lacking the enemy turn and inventory spells and abilities. Many stats are to be added too.

the text_RPG.py file showcase only basics of the process from menu to game but are on the process to be changed (using pygame to execute everything and use everything as an actual application especially for menu and printing + player inputs)
